vcs.asciidoc
============

Auto-detect and store the path to the root of the current repository, if any.

When a new buffer is created/opened, the script will try to use the following
Version Control Systems, on after the other:

* `git`
* `svn`
* `hg`
* `bzr`

As soon as a VCS returns a path, indicating that the current buffer was
created within a repository, the variable below is set.

Variables
---------

vcs_root_path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

String containing the path to the repository in which the current buffer
was created. This variable only has a value set in the `buffer` scope.

After the script has been loaded, one could use it in subsequent hooks to
apply project-wide settings (c.f. example below).

Example
-------

Adding a `tags` file (for use with the builtin `ctags` support script)
to the `ctagsfiles` option, on buffer creation:

```sh
hook global BufCreate .* %{
    %sh{
        if [ -e "${kak_opt_vcs_root_path}/tags" ]; then
            printf 'set-option -add buffer ctagsfiles %%{%s}\n' "${kak_opt_vcs_root_path}/tags"
        fi
    }
}
```
